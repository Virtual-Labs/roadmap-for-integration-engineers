* Introduction 
  The purpose of this documentation is to help the
  integration engineers in :
  - Converting the labs from VLABS ui1.0([[http://nlp-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/][blue-theme]]) to
    ui3.0([[http://ps-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][green-theme]])

* Motivation 
  The motivation behind this document is to define the VLABS
  ui3.0 template and specify guidelines to be followed
  during the lab development process.

  This document can be used to 
  - Category 1- Develop a new lab to use VLABS
    ui3.0([[http://ps-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][green-theme]]) by following the lab structure
    described below.
  - Category 2- Convert a lab from VLABS ui1.0([[http://nlp-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/][blue-theme]])
    to ui3.0([[http://ps-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][green-theme]])
  - Category 3- Convert a lab to VLABS ui3.0([[http://ps-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][green-theme]]),
    if the sources are partially updated or the lab is
    partially converted to ui3.0.
  
  Before converting a lab please ensure the category your
  lab falls into and follow the corresponding instructions.

* VLABS ui3.0 Definition 
** Category 1-Develop a new lab to use VLABS ui3.0 by following the lab structure described below.
*** Lab Structure
   
   Before you start using VLABS ui3.0 toolkit, you need to
   understand the structure of the lab.
   
   [[./images/ui3.0-lab-structure.png]]
     
*** Details of the files of VLABS ui3.0
   
   - "themes/green-icon" directory has css, images, js,
     vendors, search-result.html folders which are related
     to VLABS ui3.0 version.

   - "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1" directory has index.html,
     Introduction.html, Pre-requisites.html, Feedback.html
     etc., files which are related to the VLABS ui3.0
     version.

** Category 2- Convert a lab from VLABS ui1.0 to VLABS ui3.0
    
   Depending on the current structure of your lab, you need to follow
   the steps below to convert your lab to VLABS ui3.0 template.
  
   - Take the reference of [[http://ps-iiith.vlabs.ac.in/][Problem Solving Lab]] of IIITH,
     which has been already converted to VLABS ui3.0.
 
   - Make your lab to the above mentioned structure.  Copy
     themes/green-icon folder into the src directory of your
     lab.  This folder has all files/folders related to
     VLABS ui3.0 version.

   - Inside "src/lab" and "src/lab/exp1", add index.html,
     Introduction.html etc. Modify the content of the
     templates accordingly as per your labs content.

   - Validate: After making the changes, run your lab in the
     browser to verify whether it is converted to VLABS
     ui3.0.

** Category 3- Convert a lab to VLABS ui3.0, if the sources are partially updated or the lab is partially converted to ui3.0
   
   - Initially the analysis process is done on VLABS ui3.0
     web pages. Based on the analysis, we are done with the
     conversion process by making the required changes.
    
     For the detailed information about the conversion and
     the changes made on VLABS ui3.0 have been mentioned in
     [[https://github.com/virtual-labs/roadmap-for-integration-engineers/blob/master/ui3.0.org#cross-browser-platform][Technical Observations of VLABS ui3.0 web pages]].
                                                                      
   - Update the new responsive footer in all the html files
     (path- "src/lab" ) as per VLABS ui3.0 landing page from
     the following link:
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/index.html"

   - Go to "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/css/style.css"
     this path and copy the style.css file to the lab repo
     you are working on, to this particular path "css" and
     remove the old "css/style.css" file.  This is because
     css has been changed.  Like headers, subheaders, logo
     font size and footer has been changed in the Vlabs
     ui3.0 landing page. so, all the web pages should be
     made consistent as per the main page.

   - Go to "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/tree/master/src/images/social"
     and copy "youtube.png" image to the "images/social"
     path to the lab repo you are working on.

   - Update the new responsive footer in all the html files (path- "src/lab" )
     as per VLABS ui3.0 landing page from the following link:
     "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/index.html "

   - Go to "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/blob/master/src/css/style.css"
     this path and copy the style.css file to the lab repo you are working on,
     to this particular path "css" and remove the old "css/style.css" file.
     This is because css has been changed.  Like headers, subheaders, logo font
     size and footer has been changed in the VLABS ui3.0 landing page. so, all
     the web pages should be made consistent as per the main page.

   - Go to "https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-web-pages/tree/master/src/images/social"
     and copy "youtube.png" image to the "images/social" path to the lab repo
     you are working on.
  
   - Create green-icon folder under src/themes directory.

   - Now move css, images, js, vendors folders to the following path
     "src/themes/green-icon".

   - Create index.html file and copy the Introduction.html file content to the
     index.html file.  Note : If the index.html file already exists with the
     ui1.0 content, take a backup of that file as index.html.bak and then
     create new index.html file.

   - Edit the path inside all the html files in the following path "src/lab"
     and "src/lab/exp1".  Set the path inside the files. In the "src/lab" path
     remove ../../ inside all the files. Inside the experiments it should be
     ../ path should be given wherever it is required. This is because makefile
     is written in a such a way that it copies all the lab content and themes
     content to the build, when we run the make. So, change the path of the
     files as per your lab.
 
   - Comment out the "search box" in all html files.

   - Comment out the previous makefile and update with "[[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/physical-sciences-iiith/blob/master/src/makefile][new makefile]]" .
   
   - Finally, run a make and run the lab in the browser to see all the changes,
     which you have made. Now you should be able to see the lab converted to
     VLABS ui3.0.

* Technical Observations of VLABS ui3.0 web pages
** Cross Browser Platform
   - Tested the lab on various platforms( OS with different browsers).
  
   - Used an online cross browser compatibility testing
     tool([[https://www.browserstack.com/][browserstack]]) to check the responsive of the VLABS
     ui3.0 web pages on different resolutions.

   - Link to see the responsiveness of labs in [[https://www.browserstack.com/responsive?utm_campaign=onboarding&utm_medium=email&utm_source=welcome][mobiles and tablets.]]

* Conclusion
   However, the labs linked to the landing page with the
   VLABS ui1.0 web pages are not responsive at all. So, it
   is suggested to convert to VLABS ui3.0 for better
   usability.
 - After conversion, your lab should match the directory
   structure as detailed above and should resemble the
   following [[./images/sample-exp.png]].
