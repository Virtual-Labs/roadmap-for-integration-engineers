** About this Document

*Objective*

This document provides a roadmap to the Integration Engineers of
Virtual Labs to transform their labs sources from Integration level 0
to Integration level 6. 

This document describes the steps to be undertaken, reference
documents and the necessary support needed by the Integration Engineers
during the transformation process.

** Pre-requisites

The Integration Engineers must have access to the source
files of their labs. They are expected to know the following:
    - Execute basic shell commands in CentOS 6.5
    - Create and delete a container in OpenVZ virtual environment
    - Create or modify an HTML page and write code in JavaScript
    - Use git, a version control tool

The Integration Engineers are expected to have the following system requirements:
    + Minimum 2GB RAM
    + The machine should have one dedicated partition for CentOS
      (version 6.5 only)
    + Minimum 50GB hard disk space
    + 64-bit processor
    + The machine should have a dual core processor
                                                                                                                                            
** Integration levels
During the integration process, the source code of the labs move
through various levels of automation. The objective of the document is to help you
tranform your lab sources from Level 0 to Level 6 as described below:

- Level 0 : Unversioned
- Level 1 : Under version control
- Level 2 : Manually built on developer's machine
- Level 3 : Build process is automated
- Level 4 : Ready with deployment specification
- Level 5 : Life cycle management
- Level 6 : Add backup scripts and Request for Hosting
You must document the steps taken during the integration process in
the wiki page of your lab repository on GitHub.
  
** Transformation Process from Level 0 to Level 6
The task of an Integration Engineer is to transform the lab sources
to level 6 from its current level. Described below is the
process of transformation of lab sources at each level.


*** Level 0 
Your lab is at level 0 if your lab sources are unversioned. At this
 level, the source code of your lab will look like the sample below:
 [[./level-0.png]]

*** Level 1
The goal of level 1 is to have the source code versioned on GitHub.

*APPENDIX A* covers a tutorial on version control. Along with the
version controlled code, the source code of the lab has to be
structured and organized as follows:

#+begin_example
    - /src
        |
        ---- /lab
	|
        ---- /images
        | 
        ---- /exp     
               |
               ---- /exp1
	              |
                      ---- /img
                      | 
                      ---- /js      
	       |
               ----  /exp2
                       |    
                       ---- /img
	               |
                       ---- /js
        |
        ---- /lib
        |
        ---- /themes
        |
        ---- /help
    - /scripts (if any)
#+end_example

Below is a sample screenshot of how a level 1 source looks like:
[[./level-1.png]]

*** Level 2
The goal of level 2 is to manually build and deploy the lab in the
developer environment. Before the deployment of labs, it is advisable
to restructure your labs according to UI toolkit 1.0. 

*Step 1:* Restructure the source code of your lab as per UI toolkit
1.0. You can refer to the documentation [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/lik][here]] to restructure your labs.

*Step 2:* Now you move on to the task of deploying a lab. First,
install OpenVZ and create a container in the virtual environment. You
can view the tutorial on how to install OpenVZ and create containers
[[https://github.com/prakashbh/lik/blob/master/user-docs/intro-to-openvz.org][here]].
 
*Step 3:* Next, you need to log in to the container and install the
dependent packages for the lab such as php, apache, mongodb etc. 

Note: If your dependencies are incompatible with your platform, your package
installation may be unsuccessful. In such a scenario, you may get in
touch with VLEAD for further assistance.

*Step 4:* After successful package installation, you need to
 compile the source files and create a =build= directory with all the
 executables.

*Step 5:* Next, copy the build to
#+begin_example 
/var/www/
#+end_example

Finally, your lab is deployed. Open
a browser and type =container id= to see your lab.

*** Level 3 
The goal of level 3 is to automate the build process by writing a =make= file.

*Step 1:* The lab source code is bound to change in the development environment or
the test environment. Doing a manual build after every change is a
time-consuming process. Therefore, the process is automated by writing a
=make= file.  In simple terms, the =make= file sequentially runs all the
necessary commands to convert the source code to executables and
populates the build.  The copying process of =build= to the required
=/var/www/= directory is also automated.

A sample make file for a level 3 lab looks like [[./makefile][this]]. You can also
refer to the tutorial on [[http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf][How to Write Make]].

*Step 2:* Upon successful completion of the process, the lab is
deployed. Open a browser and type =container id= to see your lab.

*Step 3:* Now you need to push these changes to the GitHub repository.
 
*** Level 4
The goal of level 4 is to develop a lab deployment specification, also
called a labspec.

A labspec contains the necessary information related to lab hosting
and deployment such as software, hardware, platform, technologies,
authors etc.

*Step 1:* You can refer to a sample labspec created for a lab
[[./labspec.json][here]]. The template to populate your own labspec can be found [[./labspec_template.json][here]].

*Step 2:* After the labspec is ready, use the OVPL kit to deploy the
lab.  OVPL kit has the necessary documentation and scripts to perform
auto deployment of labs. [[https://github.com/vlead/setup-ovpl-centos][Here]] is the OVPL kit for your reference.

*** Level 5
The goal of level 5 is to automate the lab deployment process. OVPL is
independent of lab-specific services. Every lab has its own set of
services to be managed.  The Integration Engineer is expected to
identify the services and automate the management of the identified
services.

For example, if a lab needs to run an "Apache" service, you can
automate the process of starting the server using a [[./startup][script]] and make it
a part of the deployment process.
 
*** Level 6
The goal of level 6 is to add scripts to the lab repository and
request to host the lab.  Following are the scripts to be added to the
repository
1. backup ( backup script is used to backup the data used by the lab )
2. restore ( restore script is used to restore the data used by the
   lab )
3. start ( start script is used to start all the services required to
   run the lab )
4. stop ( stop script is used to stop all the services on the
   container started by the lab )
5. test ( test script checks if all the services used by the lab are
   running properly )
  
+ Raise an issue on [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/engineers-forum][engineers-forum]] to host the lab.

** Conclusion
Now you have concluded the transformation process of the lab. Push all
your changes to the GitHub repository and send a confirmation email to
the VLEAD team.

** APPENDIX A - Version Control and GitHub

The objective of this appendix is to describe why to use version
control and how to use "GitHub" as a version control tool.

The environment we work generally has timely code releases with multiple
developers working together. The biggest challenge in such a dynamic working condition is tracking 
changes and co-ordinating the work of every developer. In other terms we need a version control.

Version control supports below mentioned features:
       + Facility to log every version
       + Ability to differentiate between several versions
       + Revert back to required version
       + Provide better collaboration among working team
       + Convenient way of sharing data
       + Facilitate backup of all versions produced

More details about version control can be found [[http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control][here]]

GitHub is one of the many version control tools available today for
version control. Following is the procedure to create an account on
GitHub and set up a repository.

*** Account creation on Github

Step-1: Go to https://github.com/ and create your personal account by
chosing a username.  Enter your email and password and click on
"Signup for GitHub". Refer to screenshot below:
#+attr_html: :scale=0.5
[[./Step-1.png]]

Step-2: You will be asked to choose your plan. Opt for "Free"
which is seen as the last option unless you want to go for paid
plans. Refer to screenshot below:
#+attr_html: :width 10px
[[./Step-2.png]]

Step-3: Click on "Finish signup" to finish the final step.

*** Creating a Repository 

**** Creation of teams. 
 We have 2 teams namely, Owners and Integrators. 
 + Owners - Owners will create the repositories
 + Integrators - Integrators will commit and push changes.

**** Process for repository creation 
 An integrator will make a request to the VLEAD for creation of a
 repository. The request has to be sent to the following mail id for repository creation.
#+begin_example
 engg@virtual-labs.ac.in
#+end_example

**** Naming convention of the repository 
        Engineer has to send the following data for repository creation.
        + Discipline
        + LabName
        + InstituteName

*** Hosting of labs post Level 6: Communication Process for hosting labs on cloud

After the lab is at level 6, the lab-integrator must post a hosting
request that should include: lab name, institute name, and the link to
repository of the lab sources. This needs to be posted on the
engineers forum at: https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/engineers-forum

The lab-integrator must put this hosting request under the label
"request-for-hosting".

Then VLEAD will host the lab and the lab-integrator will be informed
if the hosting is successful or not.
